<h1>Predicting Airline Passenger Satisfation with help of ML</h1>

<p>With the help of various python based machine learning and data science tools we're going to analyse and train the data. Then we'll make an attempt to build a machine learning model based on our information. The ML model will help us to predict whether a passenger is satisfied with the airline service or not.</p>
